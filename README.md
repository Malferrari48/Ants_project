# Ants_project
This project was carried out by Francesco Malferrari (me), Lucrezia Sitta and [Lorenzo Rossi](https://github.com/SnowyCoder) for the Unimore course "Apprendimento ed evoluzione in sistemi artificiali" during May-June 2021.

Although this work was optional, it was a great experience to learn a programming language (Netlogo) through which to create artificial systems that emulate natural systems.

This was also helpful in learning more about the theory involved in the exam.

For more in-depth details about the work done, I invite you to read the file "relazione.pdf".

The grade for this project (which was used to round off the written exam grade) was 30L.
